# adafruit-ft232h-breakout-case
This is a simple case for the Adafruit FT232 Breakout. It is based on [this design](https://github.com/andimoto/case_adafruit_ft232h) for the old revision of this board.

Notable differnces include:
- Header cutouts on both the top and bottom plates (for pin label visibility)
- A cutout exposing the I2C switch

## Usage
Open [the design file](./adafruit-ft232h-breakout-case.py) in [PythonSCAD](https://pythonscad.org/) and render it. `adafruit-ft232h-breakout-case.3mf` will be generated in the directory you started PythonSCAD from.
